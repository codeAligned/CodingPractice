# CodingPractice
This is mostly me practicing coding. Some interview questions, some random stuff I wrote. Enjoy!

### Leetcode
Here are my solutions to various leetcode problems. I can't guarantee that they compile with gcc but they will absolutely be accepted should they be entered into leetcode.

### Future Goals
- Some form of UI to browse the code samples
- Some form of continuous integration to ensure samples are compiling
